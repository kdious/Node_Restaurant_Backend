###### Author:      Kevin Dious (kdious@gmail.com)

This code sample is the implementation of the assignments from the Coursera Course [Server-side Development with NodeJs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development/home/welcome)

Specifically, this is [Assignment #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development/peer/CnyR4/assignment4) which is for the msot part a combinaation of Assignments 1-4 (see [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development/home/assignments) for more details).

Required node packages (run npm install '<package_name>'):  
mongoose  
mongoose-currency  
passport  
passport-local  
passport-local-mongoose  
jsonwebtoken  

This is only the implementation of the server backed.  In order to interact with the server you would need to use REST API testing tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to submit the various HTTP requests to the server.
